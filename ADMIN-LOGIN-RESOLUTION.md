## 🐛 DEBUGGING STEPS

### If Still Getting "Invalid Credentials":

#### 1. Check Browser Console (F12)
Look for any JavaScript errors or network failures

#### 2. Check Server Terminal
The new debug logs will tell you exactly where it's failing:
- `❌ User not found` → Email is wrong
- `❌ Invalid password` → Password is wrong
- `❌ Account is deactivated` → User not active
- `✅ Login successful` → Should redirect to dashboard

#### 3. Test API Session Directly
Open in browser: http://localhost:3000/api/auth/session
- If logged in: Returns user data
- If not logged in: Returns `{}`

#### 4. Try Built-in NextAuth Page
http://localhost:3000/api/auth/signin

#### 5. Clear Browser Data
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
- Clear cookies and cache
- Try again in incognito mode

## 🔍 COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### Issue 1: "Invalid email or password"
**Causes:**
- Typo in email or password
- Extra spaces in input fields
- Caps Lock is ON
- Wrong user selected (not admin)

**Solution:**
- Copy-paste credentials exactly:
  - Email: `admin@dishari.com`
  - Password: `12345678`
- Check terminal logs to see which check failed

### Issue 2: Session not persisting
**Causes:**
- NEXTAUTH_SECRET not set
- Cookies disabled
- Cross-origin issues

**Solution:**
- Verify .env.local has `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
- Check browser allows cookies
- Use http://localhost:3000 (not 127.0.0.1)

### Issue 3: Redirects to login again
**Causes:**
- User role not set correctly
- Middleware blocking admin access

**Solution:**
- Verify user role in database is "admin"
- Check if middleware exists

## 📊 WHAT HAPPENS DURING LOGIN

```
User submits form
    ↓
Browser sends POST to /api/auth/callback/credentials
    ↓
NextAuth calls authorize() function
    ↓
authorize() connects to MongoDB
    ↓
Finds user by email
    ↓
Checks if user is active
    ↓
Compares password with bcrypt
    ↓
If all OK: Creates JWT session
    ↓
Browser stores session cookie

User redirected to /admin/dashboard
```
